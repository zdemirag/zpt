* this set of fits have the new fiducial binning consistent with the Zll analysis
bins =[250,275,300,350,400,450,500,650,800,1150,1500]

* NLO samples

* qcd is from MC as an initial fit, it needs to be updated accordingly

* pu uncertainties are shape

* fix on the met_trigger both name wise (now correlated) and also the magnitude is increased to 2%
